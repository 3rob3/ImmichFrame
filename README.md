This connects to a running Immich server using their API, and makes getRandom calls to randomly show images in your collection and fileCreatedAt date. Configure your server URL, account credentials, and more in the Settings.xml file. The screen is configured in quadrants, click or touch middle/right to skip forward, middle/left to go back to last image, and middle/bottom to quit.

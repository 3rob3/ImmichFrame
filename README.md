<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a digital photo frame application that interfaces with your [immich][immich-github-url] server. It is a cross-platform C# .NET 8 project that currently supports Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Built With

* [![Avalonia][Avalonia]][Avalonia-url]

## ✨ Demo
![Screenshot 2024-03-28 at 10 10 04 AM](https://github.com/3rob3/ImmichFrame/assets/156599986/75720456-4ccc-4323-af77-b72f34952f40)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

ImmichFrame is easy to run on your desired plattform. Get the latest stable release from the [release page][releases-url] and unzip to desired folder (Linux, macOS, Windows), or install APK (Android).

> [!TIP]
> The Android-Version of ImmichFrame is available on the [Google Play Store][play-store-link]. Download it via the store for automatic updates.

### Prerequisites
- A set up and functioning immich server that is accessible by the network of the ImmichFrame device.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
### Linux
- GUI - Double-click `Immich_Frame`.
- CLI - CD into folder, and launch with `./Immich_Frame`.
- SSH - CD into folder, and launch with `DISPLAY=:0.0 ./Immich_Frame`.
- Ubuntu Desktop - Right-click Immich_Frame, properties, set 'Execute as program' to True, OK. Right-click Immich_Frame, Open with, choose 'Run Software', always use for this file type TRUE.
- If you get a permissions error run `chmod +x Immich_Frame`.
#### Autostart on Raspberry Pi OS
The latest Raspberry Pi OS, Bookworm uses Wayland as default, but also includes X11. The following assumes standard user is `pi` and you are working on a fresh install of "Raspberry Pi OS with desktop".
To autostart ImmichFrame in Wayland, run `nano /home/pi/.config/wayfire.ini` in terminal, to add the following at the end.
```
[autostart]
immichframe=/home/pi/{dir with Immich_Frame}/Immich_Frame
```
Wayland does not have an easy way to hide the cursor. If you want that, then change to X11 as the default desktop session through running `sudo raspi-config` in terminal, then Advanced Options &rarr; Wayland &rarr; X11.
Then install unclutter:
```
sudo apt install -y unclutter-xfixes
```
After this, copy the default autostart file to your home folder and add a line to enable autostart.
```
cp /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
echo "@/home/pi/{dir with Immich_Frame}/Immich_Frame" > sudo tee /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
```
### Windows
- Double-click `Immich_Frame.exe`.
- Screensaver - Rename `Immich_Frame.exe` to `Immich_Frame.scr`. Right-click &rarr; Install. Configure screensaver settings and apply.
  - You will still have to click middle/bottom in the app to exit screensaver.
### MacOS
- GUI - Double-click `Immich_Frame`. Note: If nothing happens, right-click &rarr; open with &rarr; Utilities &rarr; Terminal. Check Always Open With.
- CLI - CD into folder, and launch with `./Immich_Frame`.
- If you get a permissions error run `chmod +x Immich_Frame`.
### Android Screensaver
- Run the app normally and configure settings.
- Go to Settings, Display, Advanced, Screen Saver, Current Screen Saver, choose ImmichFrame. Settings, Display, Advanced, Sleep, choose your sleep timeout. The menu options may differ slightly on different Android versions.
### Android TV Screensaver
- If you are unable to set ImmichFrame as a screen saver you may need to run this ADB command `adb shell settings put secure screensaver_components com.immichframe.immichframe/.ScreenSaverService`
## Settings
There are two options for configuring ImmichFrame; Settings.json (Linux, macOS, Windows), or a GUI based settings screen (all platforms). 

### Settings.json
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure to copy the **Settings.example.json** and name it **Settings.json**. 
 
1. Rename the `Settings.example.json` file to `Settings.json`
2. Change `ImmichServerUrl` to your domain or local ip
   ```json
   "ImmichServerUrl": "http://yourdomain.com",  
   or
   "ImmichServerUrl": "192.168.0.100:2283",  
   ```
3. Change `ApiKey`. Read more about how to obtain an [immich API key][immich-api-url]
   ```json
   "ApiKey": "YourApiKey", 
   ```
4. *Optional:* Choose albums you would like to display
   ```json
   "Albums": ["First Album UID","Second Album UID"],
   ```
> [!TIP]  
> You can get the Album UID from the URL of the album. For this URL: `https://demo.immich.app/albums/85c85b29-c95d-4a8b-90f7-c87da1d518ba` this is the UID: `85c85b29-c95d-4a8b-90f7-c87da1d518ba`

5. *Optional:* Choose people you would like to display
   ```json
    "People": ["First Person UID","Second Person UID"],
   ```
> [!TIP]  
> You can get the Person UID from the URL of the person. For this URL: `https://demo.immich.app/people/faff4d55-e859-4f6c-ae34-80f14da486c7` this is the UID: `faff4d55-e859-4f6c-ae34-80f14da486c7`

6. *Optional:* Weather is enabled by entering an API key. Get yours free from [OpenWeatherMap][openweathermap-url]
```json
    "WeatherApiKey": "YourApiKey",
    "WeatherLatLong": "YourLatitude,YourLongitude",
   ```
7. Adjust other settings to your needs

### Settings GUI
The same information as in `Settings.json` will be enterred from this screen. Can be enterred at any time by clicking the upper middle quadrant of the screen (or Up arrow key), see `Interactions` section. Settings can also be backup/restored from here.
